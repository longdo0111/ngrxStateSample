# ngrxStateSample
This tiny project aims to demonstrate the usage of state management using ngrx/store library.
There are two children components (book-list and book-collection) together with the parent (app component) which displays both children components.
Once a book is added to the collection from the book-list component, almost immediately it is displayed in the book-collection. This process is managed by the state management.
